"""
hpclint.diagnose — post-run analysis for a finished Slurm job.

Wraps `sacct` to pull a job's final state and exit code, and translates
common failure patterns (OOM kill, timeout, segfault, node failure) into
plain language with a likely cause and next step.

Same split as monitor.py: parsing/translation logic is pure and tested
against realistic fixture text; the subprocess wrapper needs a real
Slurm cluster and gets verified there per the project's end-to-end
verification plan.
