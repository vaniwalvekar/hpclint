"""
hpclint.slurm — one safe way to run Slurm CLI commands (squeue/sstat/sacct).

Centralises the things every wrapper must get right so a problem on a real
cluster produces a clear message instead of a stack trace:
  - never shells out (args are always a list)
  - a hard timeout, so an unreachable slurmctld/SlurmDBD can't hang forever
  - a clean error type for "command missing", "timed out", or "exited non-zero"

A non-zero exit is treated as a *failure*, distinct from an empty-but-successful
result (which means "job not found"), so callers never confuse the two.
